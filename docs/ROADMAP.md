# NicaClaw-lite Roadmap

Welcome to the **NicaClaw-lite** roadmap! We are building the world's most efficient, hardware-agnostic AI agent.

## 🌟 Vision
To provide an ultra-lightweight, multi-API AI assistant that can run on any device, from a $10 RISC-V board to a decade-old Android phone, without compromising on intelligence or usability.

## 🚀 Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- [x] Initial Go rewrite from TypeScript.
- [x] Memory optimization to <10MB.
- [x] Sub-second boot times.
- [x] Core tool integrations (File system, CLI, Web Search).
- [x] Multi-platform binary compilation (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android/Termux).

## ⚡️ Phase 2: Resilience & Optimization (Current)
- [x] **Multi-API Fallback Engine**: Seamless recovery from API failures or rate limits.
- [x] **Zero-Code Provider Addition**: Unify all OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- [x] Load balancing across multiple API keys.
- [x] AVX2/SIMD Assembly optimization for local processing hotspots.
- [x] Premium documentation and clean, lightweight project structure.

## 🔮 Phase 3: Hyper-Optimization & Edge Autonomy (Upcoming)
- [ ] **Local Model Manager**: A built-in, highly optimized tool to download, quantize, and execute small AI models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) directly on the device.
- [ ] **Extreme Binary Shrinking**: Further optimization techniques to reduce the standalone binary size even more.
- [ ] **Zero-Overhead Memory Pool**: Custom memory allocation strategies for absolute rock-solid stability on extremely low-RAM devices (< 5MB).
- [ ] **Voice Interface**: Native integration with lightweight TTS and STT engines for walkie-talkie mode.
- [ ] **P2P Agent Swarms**: Allow multiple NicaClaw-lite instances to communicate and delegate tasks efficiently over local networks.

## 🤝 How to Contribute
We are always looking for help! Whether it's adding a new tool, translating documentation, or testing on obscure hardware, your contributions are welcome.
